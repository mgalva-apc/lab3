    <div id="thankyou">
        <p>The last semester was a tough yet fun rollercoaster, and I'm glad I was able to experience this with the class! Everyone has been very nice and I am deeply grateful to everyone who has supported and helped me in the creation of this site. The sem has ended but I don't think this is an experience I can forget after all the fun memories and challenges we did together.</p>
        <p>To you, user, who is reading the message, I hope you'll find the website as fun of an experience as I hoped it would be!</p>
