        <h1>"Did you choose this course? Why or why not?"</h1>
        <p><strong>Yes</strong>. Although my passion was and still is leaning more towards arts and literature, I've come to realize that I have neither enough funds to support it nor any remarkable professional-level skill to help me achieve anything in the field. Compsci related jobs are known to be high paying with opportunities to work remotely, and skill-wise I believed I could do just fine with enough learning. <strong>If I could have a high paying job that may eventually allow me to be more flexible with my personal schedule, I would be able to achieve a well-balanced life that aligns with my goals.</strong>d </p>

        <h1>"What are your goals in life?"</h1>
        <p>Generally, I want to achieve <strong>a stable life with a steady income that allows me to afford luxuries not currently accessible to me with a flexible enough schedule that lets me still have time to allot for recreational activities</strong>. Having enough money would also allow me to be able to support my family and support my passions. I also have a few goals that I've set to contribute to my general goal, which just includes <strong>being able to travel</strong> to certain countries and one day <strong>have a cafe of my own and have the capacity to take in shelter animals and strays to give them better lives</strong>.</p>

        <h1>"What do you expect to learn from this course?"</h1>
        <p>From the suggestion given to me by a friend, I'm looking into a career related to website programming, specifically Front-End. I think the course will be more <strong>focused on back-end web programming</strong>, but I think the learning outcomes we will achieve here would be very <strong>helpful for my current career goals and would greatly contribute to the improvement of my skills</strong>.</p>

        <p>When I was younger, i wanted to be a "princess:" in a sense that I was someone who was good at many things all at once. Now I'm 20 years old with a wide variety of different skills and I think I made my younger self proud. I also have 6 cats, namely Silky, Almond, Tofu, Maru, Millie, and Snowball. </p>
